abstract="In multiuser groupware systems, consistency maintenance and concurrency control are the most significant challenges. In groupware systems, user groups are permitted to update the shared data simultaneously. Operational transformation (OT) is a successful method for consistency maintenance in multiuser shared applications. OT, in general, supports two basic operations: insert/delete for character operations. We have done the literature review of the evolution of OT algorithms over the last 25Â years since 1989. OT is discussed based on existing main OT algorithms such as dOPT, adOPT, GOT, GOTO, SDT, SOCT2, SOCT3/4, and ABT which are analyzed on the basis of the main properties as criteria of correctness, remote operation property, storage, etc. Then, categorization is done for all existing OT algorithms on the basis of major existing algorithms such as dOPT, adOPTed, GOT, GOTO, SDT, SOCT2, SOCT3/4, and ABT and then further classified on the basis of area of operation like undo, char, string, web, graph, etc. OT algorithms supporting string handling are also analyzed.",
